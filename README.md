# Library-Management-System
It is a relational database project designed to perform CRUD operations that tracks book inventory and book issue/return status of the registered employees.


## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `Library_Management_Project`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(30),
            contact_no VARCHAR(15)
);


-- Create table "Employee"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees
(
            emp_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            emp_name VARCHAR(30),
            position VARCHAR(30),
            salary DECIMAL(10,2),
            branch_id VARCHAR(10),
            FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES  branch(branch_id)
);


-- Create table "Members"

CREATE TABLE members
(
            member_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            member_name VARCHAR(30),
            member_address VARCHAR(30),
            reg_date DATE
);



-- Create table "Books"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
CREATE TABLE books
(
            isbn VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
            book_title VARCHAR(80),
            category VARCHAR(30),

);



-- Create table "IssueStatus"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS issued_status;
CREATE TABLE issued_status
(
            issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_member_id VARCHAR(30),
            issued_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            issued_date DATE,
            issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id) REFERENCES employees(emp_id),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn) 
);



-- Create table "ReturnStatus"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS return_status;
CREATE TABLE return_status
(
            return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_id VARCHAR(30),
            return_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            return_date DATE,
            return_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            FOREIGN KEY (return_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn)
);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1: Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
**Task 3: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';
```

**Task 4: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';
```


### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

**Task 5. Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 6: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1
```

**Task 7: List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';
```

**Task 8: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;
```

## 4. Advanced Operations

**Task 9: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql
SELECT 
    ist.issued_member_id,
    m.member_name,
    bk.book_title,
    ist.issued_date,
    -- rs.return_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date as over_dues_days
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
members as m
    ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN 
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE 
    rs.return_date IS NULL
    AND
    (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1
```


**Task 10: Update Book Status on Return**  
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).


```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_return_records(p_return_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_book_quality VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
    v_isbn VARCHAR(50);
    v_book_name VARCHAR(80);
    
BEGIN
    -- all your logic and code
    -- inserting into returns based on users input
    INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
    VALUES
    (p_return_id, p_issued_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_book_quality);

    SELECT 
        issued_book_isbn,
        issued_book_name
        INTO
        v_isbn,
        v_book_name
    FROM issued_status
    WHERE issued_id = p_issued_id;

    UPDATE books
    SET status = 'yes'
    WHERE isbn = v_isbn;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for returning the book: %', v_book_name;
    
END;
$$


-- Testing FUNCTION add_return_records

issued_id = IS135
ISBN = WHERE isbn = '978-0-307-58837-1'

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-307-58837-1';

SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_book_isbn = '978-0-307-58837-1';

SELECT * FROM return_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS135';

-- calling function 
CALL add_return_records('RS138', 'IS135', 'Good');

-- calling function 
CALL add_return_records('RS148', 'IS140', 'Good');

```


**Task 11: Stored Procedure**
Objective: Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. 
The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issue_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
-- all the variabable
    v_status VARCHAR(10);

BEGIN
-- all the code
    -- checking if book is available 'yes'
    SELECT 
        status 
        INTO
        v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

        INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES
        (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books
            SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        RAISE NOTICE 'Book records added successfully for book isbn : %', p_issued_book_isbn;


    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Sorry to inform you the book you have requested is unavailable book_isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;
    END IF;
END;
$$

-- Testing The function
SELECT * FROM books;
-- "978-0-553-29698-2" -- yes
-- "978-0-375-41398-8" -- no
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

CALL issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104');
CALL issue_book('IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104');

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-375-41398-8'
